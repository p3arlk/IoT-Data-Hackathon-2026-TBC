Note(s):,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Figures are compiled based on the survey results of the General Household Survey (GHS) from January to December of the year concerned as well as the mid-year population estimates and may be regarded as referring to the overall situation of the whole year.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The GHS covers the land-based non-institutional population and thus does not cover (a) inmates of institutions; and (b) persons living on board vessels. The land-based non-institutional population constitutes about 99% of the Hong Kong Resident Population.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Number of persons are rounded to the nearest hundred.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Figures may not add up to the total due to rounding.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For annual estimates less than 1 000, they should be interpreted with caution due to relatively large sampling error.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1 The boundaries of the Wan Chai district and Eastern district adopted since 2016 are different from those adopted in 2015 and earlier years. Therefore, figures of the Wan Chai and Eastern districts for 2016 and thereafter are not strictly comparable with those for 2015 and earlier years in this table.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
