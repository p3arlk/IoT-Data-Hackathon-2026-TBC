Note(s):,,,,,,,
"Number of domestic households are rounded to the nearest hundred.Figures in the table may not add up to the total due to rounding.For annual estimates less than 1 000 and quarterly estimates less than 3 000, they should be interpreted with caution due to relatively large sampling error.Starting from 2001, annual figures are compiled based on the survey results of the General Household Survey from January to December of the year concerned as well as the mid-year population estimates and may be regarded as referring to the overall situation of the whole year. ",,,,,,,
"1 Domestic household consists of a group of persons who live together and make common provision for essentials for living. These persons need not be related. If a person makes provision for essentials for living without sharing with other persons, he/she is also regarded as a household. In this case, the household is a one-person household. A domestic household must have at least one member who is a Usual Resident. Households comprising Mobile Residents only are not classified as domestic households.",,,,,,,
