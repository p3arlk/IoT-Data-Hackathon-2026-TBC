"For annual estimates less than 1 000, they should be interpreted with caution due to relatively large sampling error.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1 Labour force refers to the land-based non-institutional population aged 15 and over who satisfy the criteria for being classified as employed persons or unemployed persons. Inmates of institutions and persons living on board vessels are excluded.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"3 The boundaries of the Wan Chai district and Eastern district adopted since 2016 are different from those adopted in 2015 and earlier years. Therefore, figures of the Wan Chai and Eastern districts for 2016 and thereafter are not strictly comparable with those for 2015 and earlier years in this table.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
