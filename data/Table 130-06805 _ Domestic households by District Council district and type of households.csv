Note(s):,,,,
Figures are compiled based on the survey results of the General Household Survey (GHS) from January to December of the year concerned as well as the mid-year population estimates and may be regarded as referring to the overall situation of the whole year.,,,,
The GHS covers the land-based non-institutional population and thus does not cover (a) inmates of institutions; and (b) persons living on board vessels. The land-based non-institutional population constitutes about 99% of the Hong Kong Resident Population.,,,,
Number of domestic households are rounded to the nearest hundred.,,,,
Figures may not add up to the total due to rounding.,,,,
"For annual estimates less than 1 000, they should be interpreted with caution due to relatively large sampling error.",,,,
"1 Domestic household consists of a group of persons who live together and make common provision for essentials for living. These persons need not be related. If a person makes provision for essentials for living without sharing with other persons, he/she is also regarded as a household. In this case, the household is a one-person household. A domestic household must have at least one member who is a Usual Resident. Households comprising Mobile Residents only are not classified as domestic households.",,,,
2 Economically active household is a domestic household with at least one member (excluding foreign domestic helpers) being economically active.,,,,
"3 Economically inactive household is a domestic household with all members (excluding foreign domestic helpers) being economically inactive (e.g. home-makers/retired persons not available for work or not seeking work and those below the age of 15, etc).",,,,
"4 The boundaries of the Wan Chai district and Eastern district adopted since 2016 are different from those adopted in 2015 and earlier years. Therefore, figures of the Wan Chai and Eastern districts for 2016 and thereafter are not strictly comparable with those for 2015 and earlier years in this table.",,,,
